Minos support can use public read-only endpoints for beginner diagnostics.

Safe public GET endpoint categories:

- platform health
- subnet info
- public scoring summaries
- public miner history and metrics by hotkey
- public current and finalized leaderboards
- public network stats
- public validator dashboard data when exposed

Signed POST endpoints are managed by the official miner software. Beginners should not manually construct signed requests, signatures, active nonces, authorization headers, or submission payloads.

Use public endpoints to answer questions like:

- "Is the platform healthy?"
- "Is this hotkey scoring?"
- "Is my miner eligible?"
- "Why is PM2 online but weight is 0?"
- "Who is on the latest finalized leaderboard?"

Use Minos MCP when available for live/current data. Use the `@minos` graph for stable interpretation and safety guidance.
