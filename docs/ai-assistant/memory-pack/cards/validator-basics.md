Minos validators score miners by rerunning submitted configs or pipelines and benchmarking the generated calls.

Public validator concepts:

- validators verify miner work instead of trusting miner-provided output
- validator workloads are heavier than normal miner operation
- validators need reliable Docker, CPU, RAM, disk, reference data, and scoring resources
- benchmark comparison uses private validator-side truth data
- validator weights follow public subnet and scoring rules

Public repo entrypoints may include:

```bash
bash start-validator.sh
bash pm2-validator.sh
```

Use the public repository README and scripts for exact current setup steps.

Do not upload private validator configs, truth files, confident regions, private benchmark data, database output, or infrastructure details into Ditto.
