A SNP is a single-base change at a genomic position.

An indel is an insertion or deletion relative to the reference genome.

Variant callers often behave differently on SNPs and indels. A configuration that helps SNP recall may not help indel quality, and a strict filter that reduces false positives may also remove true variants.

Minos scoring can reflect multiple quality dimensions. Beginner tuning should avoid chasing one number without checking whether another score component gets worse.

Safe explanation pattern:

- "This setting may affect sensitivity or filtering."
- "Compare several scored rounds before trusting a change."
- "Use public score summaries and public endpoint data."
- "Do not optimize against private truth files."
