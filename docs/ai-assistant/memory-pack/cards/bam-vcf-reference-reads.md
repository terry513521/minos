Minos miners should understand these file concepts at a high level.

Reads are sequencing fragments. They are the raw evidence a variant caller uses.

A reference genome is the baseline genome sequence. Reads are aligned to reference coordinates so tools can compare sample evidence against the reference.

BAM files usually contain aligned reads. BAM files can be large and may reveal private or challenge-specific data. Do not paste private BAM content or private BAM URLs into public support.

VCF files contain variant calls such as SNPs and indels. Miner support should focus on the official miner flow and public score output, not manual VCF paste-back.

Truth VCFs and confident-region files are validator-side benchmark materials. They must never be shared publicly or uploaded into a public knowledge graph.

Public-safe support can discuss what these file types mean, common error categories, and public logs after secrets and private paths are removed.
