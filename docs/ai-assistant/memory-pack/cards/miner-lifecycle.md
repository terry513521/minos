A normal Minos miner lifecycle is:

1. Install the public Minos miner code.
2. Make sure Docker works.
3. Create or attach a Bittensor wallet and hotkey.
4. Run demo mode first.
5. Register the hotkey on subnet 107 when ready.
6. Start live mining through the official script.
7. Watch public score, eligibility, weight, and history.
8. Tune carefully only after valid scored results exist.

Demo success does not guarantee live rewards, but it is the right first gate because it confirms the local runtime can complete the workflow. Demo mode does not persist live submissions, does not earn TAO, and does not produce real live scores.

PM2 "online" means the process manager sees a running process. It does not prove the miner is registered, submitting, scoring, eligible, weighted, or earning.

For current miner status, use Minos MCP or public endpoints. Static `@minos` memory should explain how to interpret the results.
