## Safe Public GET Endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v2/info`
- `GET /reference/{path}`
- `GET /scoring/all`
- `GET /scoring/detailed/{hotkey}`
- `GET /scoring/metagraph/miners`
- `GET /scoring/weights`
- `GET /scoring/rounds`
- `GET /scoring/rounds/current/leaderboard`
- `GET /scoring/rounds/latest-finalized/leaderboard`
- `GET /dashboard/network-stats`
- `GET /dashboard/miner-history/{hotkey}`
- `GET /dashboard/miner-metrics/{hotkey}`
- `GET /dashboard/recent-activity`
- `GET /dashboard/validators`

## Miner-Software-Managed Signed POST Endpoints

- `POST /v2/round-status`
- `POST /v2/submit-config`
- `POST /v2/demo/round-status`
- `POST /v2/demo/submit-result`

Beginners should not manually call signed POST endpoints. The miner software handles request signing and submission.

## Safe Use Cases

- check whether the platform is healthy
- find public UID/hotkey/metagraph status
- check score, eligibility, and weight
- inspect current or latest finalized leaderboard
- inspect public miner score history
- inspect public network stats

## Not For Beginner Support

Do not suggest admin endpoints, database access, production environment details, private validator files, truth files, presigned URL inspection, or manual signed request construction.
