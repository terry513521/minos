This is a public beginner guide for using Ditto while onboarding as a Minos subnet 107 miner.

## What Minos Mining Is

Minos is a Bittensor subnet for genomic variant calling. Miners run tools such as GATK, DeepVariant, or BCFtools on benchmark genomic data. Validators re-run submitted tool configs and score the resulting calls against benchmark truth data.

Miners submit variant-calling configurations, not VCF files.

## What Ditto Can Help With

Ditto can help explain:

- setup and demo mode
- Docker and PM2 basics
- BAM, VCF, reads, variants, SNPs, and indels
- why a miner has 0 weight
- eligibility, weight, rewards, and pruning dust at a high level
- public validator basics
- public endpoint checks
- safe troubleshooting
- basic config-tuning tradeoffs

## What Ditto Cannot Help With

Ditto should not handle secrets or private infrastructure data. Do not paste private keys, seed phrases, `.env` files, API keys, SSH keys, presigned URLs, truth files, private validator data, or admin/database details.

## Recommended Beginner Path

1. Set up the miner.
2. Run demo mode first.
3. Confirm files download.
4. Confirm Docker and the selected variant caller run.
5. Confirm a result/config is produced.
6. Move to live mining.
7. Wait for scored rounds.
8. Check eligibility and weight.
9. Only then tune configs.

## Common Commands

Use the official installer first, then start in demo mode if you are new:

```bash
bash install.sh
bash start-miner.sh --demo
```

When you are ready for live mining, configure/register your wallet first, then
start the miner:

```bash
bash start-miner.sh --setup
bash start-miner.sh
bash pm2-miner.sh
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs minos-miner --lines 50
curl https://api.theminos.ai/health
```

## Demo Mode First

Demo mode is a pipeline smoke test. It uses the platform's `/v2/demo/*` sandbox. Demo mode does not earn TAO. Demo mode does not persist live submissions. Demo mode does not produce real live scores. It is useful because it proves your local environment can run the workflow before you risk live rounds.

## PM2 Online Is Not Enough

PM2 online means the process is running. It does not prove that the miner is participating, submitting, scored, eligible, weighted, or earning emissions.

## How To Ask Ditto For Help

Good prompt:

```text
I am a Minos miner in live mode. PM2 says online but I have 0 weight. My public UID is 38. /scoring/all shows score X, eligible false, weight 0. Here are the last 40 redacted PM2 log lines.
```

Bad prompt:

```text
Here is my .env and presigned URL. Tell me why mining failed.
```
