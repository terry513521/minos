"""
EMA-based weight distribution with participation gating and score decay.

Tracks miner performance over time with exponential moving averages.
Weight distribution has two phases:

- Warmup (before any miner reaches min_rounds): positional reward split
  50/30/20 among the top 3 scoring active miners (>= 1 round) by EMA.
- Normal (once any miner is eligible): winner-takes-all — the single
  top-performing eligible miner receives 100% of the weight.

Eligibility requires scoring in at least `min_rounds` of the recent window.
Tiebreaker: earliest submission timestamp in the most recent round.

Inactive miners' EMA scores decay each round they miss, preventing stale
high scores from persisting indefinitely.
